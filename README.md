# TIC-TAC-TOE

This project is a culmination of concepts covered over the last three weeks. My favorite aspect of the project is the CSS and the ability to turn the website into something nostalgic of a childhood memory. The aesthetics of MySpace, Tumblr, the Y2K Era, and Doja Cat served as influences.
